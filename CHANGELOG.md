# Changelog

Release notes for the Screens app — both the CMS (auto-deployed to Cloud Run
on every merge to `main`) and the Android player APK (built + published by
GitHub Actions on each tagged release). See [README → Releasing](README.md#releasing)
for how versions are cut.

The matching section below is used **verbatim** as the GitHub Release body and
the in-app "what's new" the player overlay shows. Write it for Ben and the
people installing the APK, not for engineers.

Rules:
- Newest at the top.
- Header is exactly `## vX.Y.Z` (leading `v`, no date, no trailing text) — the
  release workflow keys off this format.
- Plain-English bullets: what changed and why it matters.
- One section per version; don't edit an already-released section.

## v0.1.0

First versioned release. Everything that landed in the auth + persistence push
on 2026-05-08 is now bundled under one number.

- **Google Sign-In** for the CMS. Anyone with a `@smartechworld.com`,
  `@smartech.buzz`, `@smartechwrld.com`, or `@seeyoutmrw.com` email can sign in
  with their Google account.
- **Self-onboarding.** New sign-ins land as Viewer (read-only) and show up in
  Settings → Users. The Owner promotes them from there.
- **Users & permissions page.** Invite, edit role, disable, remove. Owner row
  is locked against demotion or deletion.
- **Roles:** Owner (singular), Super admin, Admin, Manager, User, Viewer, Brand
  partner. Sidebar items and API routes are gated by role from a central
  permissions matrix.
- **Persistent user store** on Cloud Storage. Users + sessions survive Cloud
  Run restarts and revision rollovers.
- **Heartbeat fix** for tablets that had saved an `http://` server URL —
  auto-upgrades to `https://` on boot so they reconnect after the Cloud Run
  deploy.
- **Live Activity log** and **CMS library auto-refresh** so changes show up
  without a hard reload.
- **TV mode polish** on the player APK: amber focus ring, BackHandler chain,
  hold-OK staff unlock gated to the player loop, dynamic HDMI resolution.
- **Drive API integration** for the cloud deploy — brand content streams
  through `/media/<drive_id>` and splash videos hydrate to a local cache on
  boot.
